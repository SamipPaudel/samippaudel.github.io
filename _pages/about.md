Hello! I am Samip Paudel, a high school student from Rupandehi, Nepal. I am a driven and resourceful student with a strong desire to innovate and discover more profound meaning. My diverse interests all intersect in the areas of  Mathematics, and AI. I intend to look into many facets of these subjects and use my skills and knowledge to advance our understanding and tackle significant challenges.
